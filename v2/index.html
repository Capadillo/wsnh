                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>EXTERRA In-Ground Stations are placed in the ground around the exterior of the structure at intervals not exceeding 3 meters. It may be necessary to form holes in slabs, pavers or asphalt to place In-Concrete Stations. In addition, Above-Ground Stations are placed directly on areas where live termites are located and considered to be feeding.</p>
                <p>EXTERRA Stations are inspected no more than 12 weeks apart. During inspections of unbaited stations, the timber Interceptors are visually inspected. When termite activity is discovered in a Station, REQUIEM Termite Bait is added. REQUIEM is placed in the vacant cavity at the center of the Station in contact with the Interceptors</p>
                <p>REQUIEM Baited Stations are re-inspected every 2-6 weeks. Stations are continually replenished in order to make sure that REQUIEM bait is always present in the Station.</p>
                <p>When termite feeding in an In-ground Station has been absent for a period of time, the Station (and any remaining bait) is removed. The Station is cleaned out and fresh Interceptors and Focus Termite Attractant is added.</p>
                <p>This proposal is for a 12-month cover period. The EXTERRA system will require renewal after the initial 12-month cover period. The renewal cost also includes a Timber Pest Inspection with report.</p>
                <p><strong>Installation:</strong> <ins id="install">$0.00</ins></p>
                <p><strong>Renewal:</strong> <ins id="renewal">$0.00</ins></p>
                <h2>Install Details</h2>
                <p>The total number of stations to be installed are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><ins id="soil">0</ins> In-Ground Stations</li>
                    <li><ins id="concrete">0</ins> In-Concrete Stations</li>
                    <li>Above-Ground Stations are installed as required.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The expected installation time for one technician is <ins id="duration">0</ins> hours.</p>
                <p>* Access to electricity and water is REQUIRED for the installation of In-Concrete Stations.</p>
                <p>* Pipe locator services may be required if there is concern of pipes being in the install area. This is at an additional cost of approximately $440.</p>
