                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <div id="option-1-system">
                        <p>EXTERRA In-Ground Stations are placed in the ground around the exterior of the structure at intervals not exceeding 3 meters. It may be necessary to form holes in slabs, pavers or asphalt to place In-Concrete Stations. In addition, Above-Ground Stations are placed directly on areas where live termites are located and considered to be feeding.</p>
                        
                        <p>EXTERRA Stations are inspected no more than 12 weeks apart. During inspections of unbaited stations, the timber Interceptors are visually inspected. When termite activity is discovered in a Station, REQUIEM Termite Bait is added. REQUIEM is placed in the vacant cavity at the center of the Station in contact with the Interceptors</p>
                        
                        <p>REQUIEM Baited Stations are re-inspected every 2-6 weeks. Stations are continually replenished in order to make sure that REQUIEM bait is always present in the Station.</p>
                        
                        <p>When termite feeding in an In-ground Station has been absent for a period of time, the Station (and any remaining bait) is removed. The Station is cleaned out and fresh Interceptors and Focus Termite Attractant is added.</p>
                        
                        <p>This proposal is for a 12-month cover period. The EXTERRA system will require renewal after the initial 12-month cover period. The renewal cost also includes a Timber Pest Inspection with report.</p>

                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <div id="option-2-system">
                        <p>A liquid-termicide treated zone is designed to deter termites from gaining concealed access to a building or structure. The most effective method of creating an even and continuous treated zone is by trenching and treating the soil as it is backfilled. Soil injection equipment (rodding) will only be used where trenching and treating the back-fill is not possible or practical.</p>

                        <p><strong>Trenching</strong></p>
                        <p>Excavating a trench, treating the exposed trench, back filling and treating the back-fill is the preferred method of installing a treated zone. The trench will be no-less-than 150 mm wide, 80 mm deep and extend not-less-than 50mm below the top edge of the slab or footing.</p>
                        <p>If removal of concrete from the treatment area (using the above measurements) is a possibility, it is highly recommended and encouraged. Additional soil may be required if any concrete is removed.</p>

                        <p><strong>Rodding Through Concrete</strong></p>
                        <p>When applying a treated zone underneath a concrete obstruction (e.g. a path), a soil rod with a 3 to 4 way multi-directional tip will be used. The rod will be rotated during application. The tip will be inserted down as close to the footing as possible to ensure a complete treated zone. Rod spacing should not exceed 350mm and application volume will be adjusted depending on soil type.</p>

                        <p><strong>Other Information</strong></p>
                        <p>Any items stored against the wall will need to be moved away from the wall prior to the treatment taking place. This can include air conditioner units or hot water services. Moving these items is not the responsibility of the Flick Technician.</p>
                        <p>Likewise, it is recommended that any pavers be removed from the treatment area and re-placed by a suitably qualified person. If pavers need to be removed to allow for trenching of the soil, it is not the responsibility of the Flick Technician to re-place the pavers to their original condition.</p>
