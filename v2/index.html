                        <p>EXTERRA In-Ground Stations are placed in the ground around the exterior of the structure at intervals not exceeding 3 meters. It may be necessary to form holes in slabs, pavers or asphalt to place In-Concrete Stations. In addition, Above-Ground Stations are placed directly on areas where live termites are located and considered to be feeding.</p>
                        <p>EXTERRA Stations are inspected no more than 12 weeks apart. During inspections of unbaited stations, the timber Interceptors are visually inspected. When termite activity is discovered in a Station, REQUIEM Termite Bait is added. REQUIEM is placed in the vacant cavity at the center of the Station in contact with the Interceptors</p>
                        <p>REQUIEM Baited Stations are re-inspected every 2-6 weeks. Stations are continually replenished in order to make sure that REQUIEM bait is always present in the Station.</p>
                        <p>When termite feeding in an In-ground Station has been absent for a period of time, the Station (and any remaining bait) is removed. The Station is cleaned out and fresh Interceptors and Focus Termite Attractant is added.</p>
                        <p>This proposal is for a 12-month cover period. The EXTERRA system will require renewal after the initial 12-month cover period. The renewal cost also includes a Timber Pest Inspection with report.</p>
